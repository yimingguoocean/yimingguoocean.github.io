<p> I am an oceanographer studying ocean dynamic and biogeochemical processes using satellites, observations, and models. 
  My research program can be organized into the following three research directions: (1) Ocean tracer transports and their variability; 
  (2) Sources and sinks of ocean energy; and (3) Ocean carbon storage and uptake. </p>

<h1>Ocean mesoscale tracer transports</h1>

<p> About: The most energetic oceanic motions occur on the mesoscale, with lateral scales from tens to hundreds of kilometers. 
  The ubiquitous mesoscale eddies are critical in the transports of heat, salt, dissolved carbon, and other tracers in all parts of the worldâ€™s oceans. 
  The advancements in remote sensing observations of ocean topography, surface temperature, and salinity since the 1990s provide remarkable opportunities for reconstructing mesoscale-induced ocean tracer transport on ocean surface. 
  Traditional ocean models routinely used in the climate simulations do not resolve mesoscale eddies, instead parameterize them because of immense computational cost, which can largely underestimate the simulated ocean transport and energetics. 
  In recent years, significant progress has been made in incorporating the simulation of mesoscale eddies into coupled climate models, making them excellent tools for studying the mesoscale and its impact on the ocean general circulation and global climate. 
  My objective is to leverage these observations and models to develop frameworks to efficiently estimate the magnitude, spatial distribution, and temporal variations of mesoscale-induced tracer transports.

<p>
  This research direction builds on my past work that estimates eddy heat transport within ocean mixed layer and its variability across various scales using decades-long satellite observations, ocean reanalysis, and high-resolution global climate models. 
  Key findings/points include:
  <ol>
    <li> Global surface ocean eddy heat fluxes (EHFs) are reconstructed from 1993 to 2017 based on satellite observations; </li>
    <li> The divergent component is successfully extracted on the globe by performing a Helmholtz decomposition. </li>
    <li> EHF and its associated energy conversion rates in a high-resolution coupled model agree well with observation-based estimates. </li>
  </ol>
