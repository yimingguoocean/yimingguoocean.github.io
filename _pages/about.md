I am a Postdoctoral Investigator at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution with research interest in physical and biogeochemical oceanography. My research combines cutting-edge data from remote sensing, in-situ observations, reanalysis datasets, and high-resolution global models to unravel the complexities of ocean circulations across various scales and their biogeochemical impacts.
